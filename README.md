# (TODO: your game's title)

Author: Nellie Tonev

Design: There is no functioning game for this project right now. I spent a long time
working with Harfbuzz and FreeType libraries, but I got pretty stuck on creating and rendering textures. I'm going to submit anyway, 
and I really do want to figure out a good approach and understand this, so I'll come to office hours. Hopefully I can eventually return to this and 
implement something. Thanks!

Choices: (TODO: how does the game store choices and narrative? How are they authored? Anything nifty you want to point out?)

How To Play:

(TODO: describe the controls and (if needed) goals/strategy.)

This game was built with [NEST](NEST.md).
